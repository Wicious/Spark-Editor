## Spark Editor
### A Fiesta Online tool for pretty much everything.


The purpose of this project is to provide a tool that can be used to satisfy most if not all your Fiesta Online developing needs.

All code is written _completely_ from scratch, which comes with improvements. The load/save time for files has been _significantly_ reduced. Large files (~20+ MB) that in other versions could to take up to minutes to save are now saved in just a few of seconds.

The following is what this tool aims to serve as:
- SHN Editor
- Shine Editor
- Quest Editor
- Pinescript Editor
- Action Editor

Also included are smaller but very useful tools and so-called _fast tasks_ that are basically various preconfigured development-type-tasks, like for example adding items. Using these will shorten the amount of effort required.
